Bugfix
   * Fix server connection identifier setting for outgoing encrypted records
     on DTLS 1.2 session resumption. After DTLS 1.2 session resumption with
     connection identifier, the Mbed TLS client now properly sends the server
     connection identifier in encrypted record headers. Fix #5872.
