Features
   * New configuration option MBEDTLS_AES_USE_HARDWARE_ONLY introduced. When
     using CPU-accelerated AES (e.g., Arm Crypto Extensions), this option
     disables the plain C implementation and the run-time detection for the
     CPU feature, which reduces code size and avoids the vulnerability of the
     plain C implementation.
