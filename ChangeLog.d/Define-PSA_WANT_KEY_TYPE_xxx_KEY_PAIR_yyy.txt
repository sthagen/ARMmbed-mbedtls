New deprecations
   * PSA_WANT_KEY_TYPE_xxx_KEY_PAIR and
     MBEDTLS_PSA_ACCEL_KEY_TYPE_xxx_KEY_PAIR, where xxx is either ECC or RSA,
     are now being deprecated in favor of PSA_WANT_KEY_TYPE_xxx_KEY_PAIR_yyy and
     MBEDTLS_PSA_ACCEL_KEY_TYPE_xxx_KEY_PAIR_yyy. Here yyy can be: USE, IMPORT,
     EXPORT, GENERATE, DERIVE. The goal is to have a finer detail about the
     capabilities of the PSA side for either key.

Features
   * New symbols PSA_WANT_KEY_TYPE_xxx_KEY_PAIR_yyy and
     MBEDTLS_PSA_ACCEL_KEY_TYPE_xxx_KEY_PAIR_yyy (where xxx is either ECC, RSA
     or DH) were introduced in order to have finer accuracy in defining the
     PSA capabilities for each key. These capabilities, named yyy above, can be
     any of: USE, IMPORT, EXPORT, GENERATE, DERIVE.
