Features
   * It is now possible to have AEADs support (CCM, GCM and ChaChaPoly) without
     MBEDTLS_CIPHER_C. This holds both for the builtin suport (MBEDTLS_CCM_C,
     MBEDTLS_GCM_C and MBEDTLS_CHACHAPOLY_C) as well as the PSA one
     (PSA_WANT_ALG_CCM, PSA_WANT_ALG_GCM, PSA_WANT_ALG_CHACHA20_POLY1305).
     On the PSA side this means that it is possible to enable
     MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_C without MBEDTLS_CIPHER_C if none of the
     non-authenticated ciphers is enabled.
