Bugfix
    * Fix a bug whereby the the list of signature algorithms sent as part of the
      TLS 1.2 server certificate request would get corrupted, meaning the first
      algorithm would not get sent and an entry consisting of two random bytes
      would be sent instead. Found by Serban Bejan and Dudek Sebastian.
