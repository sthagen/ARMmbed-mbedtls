Features
   * When a PSA driver for ECDSA is present, it is now possible to disable
     MBEDTLS_ECDSA_C in the build in order to save code size. For PK, X.509
     and TLS to fully work, this requires MBEDTLS_USE_PSA_CRYPTO to be enabled.
     Restartable/interruptible ECDSA operations in PK, X.509 and TLS are not
     supported in those builds yet, as driver support for interruptible ECDSA
     operations is not present yet.
